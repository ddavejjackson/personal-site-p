#### WhoAmI?
Hello, nice to meet you. I am V, (obviously an alias).  

I am a 20 something year old anarchist, coder, motorbike mechanic, motorcycle lover, hacker, brother, uncle, son etc.  
I don't believe the current system (mostly politics) suits anyone apart from the UHNWI (Ultra High Net Worth Individuals).  

For this reason, I feel it is essential for the "common man" so to speak to take down the system, be a non-conformist etc.  

```java

import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class AboutMe {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Screw the System");
    }
}
